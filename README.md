Hi, Iâ€™m Ameya Tilaye! I have a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from UCLA, and graduated in 2023. Iâ€™m currently looking for full time positions in data analytics or product analytics. Both the data and product spaces are exciting. I love learning new things- currently studying personal branding, Agentic AI, and enhancing my projects.
